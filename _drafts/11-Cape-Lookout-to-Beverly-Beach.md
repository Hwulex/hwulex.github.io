title: 11 Cape Lookout to Beverly Beach
---

Alarm at 06:30 but I'd already woken up a half hour or so before, when I opened my eyes to be staring down a raccoon right outside my tent. Goddamn trash pandas. I left nothing for you!

Get up after five minutes of contemplating it. Start the day by wiping down the condensation from inside of the tent. Single skin tents to tent to have that issue, but with the cold fall nights it's worse than I've ever known. I even left a door open on each side of the tent for some airflow but didn't seem to make any difference. Fortunately it also didn't affect my temperature as I slept soundly.

Apt time for me to note the new sleeping mat was a success! Slept super well on it, even on my side for a while. For $50US I'm pretty happy with that, especially buying in Oregon tax free!

After tent is as dry as I'm gonna get it, I'm out the sleeping bag and putting on some oatmeal while I start to pack. I feel like I'm moving along well with the packing but once it's all said and done and I've changed, eaten, packed, used the washroom etc, it's 09:00 by the time I'm actually ready to roll out. How was I so slow today? The tent wipe definitely takes a bit of extra time. I need a cham-wow or something.

Today is a shorter ride covering 100km/1100m. I didn't realise this morning though that nearly half that vertical is right out the gate. Turn out of Cape Lookout and wham, 7-10% grade for 5km straight up. Legs certainly weren't warmed up, but it is one of the best bits of road I've got to ride yet. Very recently resurfaced and just silky smooth, not to mention the amazing views.

I'd ditched the jacket early but stopped to put it back on for the down and glad I did: sweating already, 7deg temperature, and descending at 55km/h.

Most of the way down, on a short flat, I caught the same woman heading to San Diego I'd spoken to before getting to Ocean City, and we had a nice chat about how we both holed up from the weather a couple days; me in Aberdeen, her lot in Astoria. I asked if they were caught in the rain and she said the last in the group just made it over the bridge as it started, and just as the tornado warning was announced. Wait, tornado warning? That explains a lot then!

I left her on the next down, and the ride from here was pretty chill for a while. Nice quiet roads, not back on the 101 for a stretch. I did during this time overtake the rest of the San Diego crew; it was the first time I'd seen any of the rest of them as I turned off the previous day before I caught them.

Further in to the ride, my GPS took me off the main road to the "old highway" and I remembered this one from the route planning. Same vertical as the highway but over a longer distance so reduced grade. Plus there's basically no cars.

Turning on to it there's no shoulder, but it's more of that butter smooth fresh surface. Oh this will be nice. Sadly that only lasted a few km and the road fast became the best and worse surface I rode all day, When the new ran out, the old was appalling. Cracked, pot holed, ridged, completely eroded. At one point the surface disappeared completely and it was 20m of pothole gravel, like fireroad.

Ignoring the inconsistent surface, it was a satisfying climb. It started off kinda too easy and was a bit boring, but then became just a good 5% consistent gradient to the top.

Saw a cycle tourer coming down at one point who was pretty well laden. He even had one of those flags off the back, that wasn't in fact a flag but a selfie stick with a gopro getting footage of him as he rode. I kinda liked it. Getting photo or video of you on the bike would be great, but I ain't carrying that thing the whole way for a few minutes of video.

Down the descent and I saw a cell tower poking up off the hill adjacent to the road, and it was just before 12pm so a quick chat with Siobhan as she'd be on her break.

Mentioned to her the stove and sleep mat worked out great so I will ship the old ones back when convenient. Keep rolling after our call and what do you know a USPS office right at the corner with the highway.

Chat to the lady in there that had me unpack the items to weight them, size for bubble mailer, only to then later tell me that she doesn't have training on her new system to send international, which I had told her at the start it was going to Canada. Anyway, she was lovely and helpful despite that and gave directions to the larger Post Office in Lincoln City.

After that faffing about the SD-crew caught me at the corner, but then pulled in to the cafe. That saves us leapfrogging I guess. I did the 5-miles to Lincoln City, but just before stopped at a pharmacy for more ibuprofen which I've been taking most mornings and during riding for my neck pain. Plus I found Berocca in there! I was wanting just more electrolyte recovery powder but stoked to find those so bought a tube.

On to the post office, it was next to a mall with Eddie Bower, Columbia, North Face, amongst others so I went in there first to see if I could find a whole new jetboil, or the Pocket Rocket stove I'd wanted when I could only buy the Coleman. No luck, but I did get an insulated water bottle so I can take tea on the go in the mornings without melting my bottle. Plus I got a cham-wow style wiper sponge for the tent. Great!

Over at USPS I sent off the defective supplies, shipping them back to myself in Canada, then continued on my way. Not far from here. The guys told me it's mostly easy riding apart from one hill to go, and "it's a doozy!". That would be the Otter <<name>> climb and it was decent, though easier than the morning from Cape Lookout. One-way road (uphill) split in to 2/3 for cars 1/3 for bikes. Really nice consistent grade up, I quite enjoyed that climb.

Down the other side I pulled in to Otter Rock to check it out, a POI I had pre-programmed to go see. Just a big hole in a cliff rock basically, but cool to see.

Easy roll downhill the last 3km to camp. Pulling in I noticed "All Star" accreditation on the state park sign. Wonder what that means?

Checking in, the ranger explained the usual, where site is, nearest shower, etc. Then told me about the food caches, which have power inside for charging, and the free tea and coffee at the welcome office. So that's what the All Star gets you!

With the errands in Lincoln City, plus the other short stops at the pharmacy and Otter Rock etc, I was a couple hours behind planned schedule: arriving 14:00 was the plan but was closer to 16:30. Still earlier than last few days and enough time to relax a bit more.

Hike and Bike site is a grassy area with treed surround and a few benches, one fire pit. Nice space, and more social than the last few which have all been separate pitches. Two tents already there: small 1-man is Ted who's walking the Oregon coast, and a larger 2-man for two girls from Quebec also cycling the coast but to LA.

Setup tent quickly, the usual game, then go for a shower. Separate room showers again are nice, and this time with taps so no pushing buttons every minute.

After shower, go to fill my new insulated bottle with free tea and check out the beach. Pretty nice, apart from the giant alien tentacle looking kelp laying abound.

Back to camp to start food while it's still light for once. Pretty excited for the tin of chop-suey vegetables I bought at Thriftway earlier, to go with the powdered coconut cream I brought from home (finally) and the thai paste I also brought (finally). Add to that some pre-cook wild rice and you've got a meal! I may have used a little too much paste, but it sure was tasty.

Sat and ate whilst chatting with Ted about this trip, previous trips, etc. Lovely to have someone else to chat with as it's been pretty solitary up until now.

9pm and gotta pack up and turn in. Write this, read a few pages, then sleep. Alarm set for 05:30. Longer day again tomorrow and I don't want to get to camp too late again.

### Roadside Randoms

- RV skylight

### Best RV Name

- Nothing notable, sadly

### Wildlife

- Alpaca, and goat. Though they were in a yard, so not exactly "wild"
- Went through the "whale watching capital". Didn't expect much, but did keep an eyes peeled for several miles. Did not see.
