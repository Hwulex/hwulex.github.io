title: 13 Umpqua to Cape Blanco
---

Got up with my alarm today at 05:40. Actually having it next to my head helps of course.

Stove not working very well so luke-warm oats and an apple.

Couple up way later but packed instantly I swear. Trouble of ultra light.

Foggy morning, forest beautiful.

Sunshine most of the day, still cool in the shade.

7 Devils Road steepest climbs yet, his 15% at one point.

Cape Blanco further off highway than my pre-made route went. Last bit was punchy climb, up 12%, with some gravel bars so can't even bomb back down tomorrow.

New hiker/biker site. Has lockers like Fort Stevens but working, with 4-USB ports per locker. Bike stand with tools, pump with gauge, and even a tin of WD40!

Shower, laundry. Too late again, never gonna dry i time.

Lighthouse trip, windy AF. Cool views.

Shantal (USA) and Varner (DEU) arrive. Solo but riding few days together. Wine!

Food, fire, cookies, wine. Chat chat chat. Wine. Bed.
