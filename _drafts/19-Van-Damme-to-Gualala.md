06:45 alarm and pack sleeping bag and mat while waiting for daylight. Double oats and apple for breakfast. Pack the rest and on road about 08:30.

Rolling hills on and off the coast most of the day. Go through some stretches of inland farming fields. One of which had 20 buzzards circling over head.

One inlet had the steepest hill out of it yet. Two big switchbacks up the side, just a big Z on the hill. The second one where we were on the inside lane so the steepest part measured 17% on my computer.

Later on the road opened up on a decent downhill and with the trailing wind I hit 80km/h, top speed on the trip yet!

Elk stores?
