title: 15 Harris Beach to Patrick's Point

Alarm at 06:30, but snoozed a few times. Finally up and starting to pack at around 07:00. I packed everything and changed before cooking today as I went over to the gazebo by the washrooms to charge devices there while I cooked which worked out well.

On the road around 09:00 and before I knew it I was at the California state line, I didn't realise it was that close. Stop for a few photos of course, and there was a convenient traffic cone next to the sign I could use for my gorilla pod.

The road surface change in to Cali was very obvious, Shantel, who was at Cape Blanco, had warned me of domestic dogs just roaming free in Cali and to have the airhorn nearby at all times. Literally the first settlement I pass through after turning off the 101 on to the Pacific Cycle Route, some damn dog charges me and chases. Fortunately I can just crank the pedals and pull away. Goddamn mutt.

So that put me in a bit of a funky mood for a while, plus the road surface then got crappier until I was back on the 101. That was great for a stretch but then turn off again as the shoulder ends and I ended up with a headwind and rough surface, which didn't help my mood.

Stopped at Big 5 Sports to get more small gas cans that fit inside the jet boil as they're the only place I reliable know that sells them. Stop further down the road at Safeway to get the night's groceries. I'll be carrying them further than I'd like and I have to go a little leaner than usual as they've got to be packed rather than in the small backpack, but I figure it out.

Back on the bike and around the bay the view is rather nice, right down at sea level. Then I enter the woods and the GPS shows a steep line straight up. 5-9% the whole way, I go sea level to 350m elevation quite quickly. Some road works on the way so the odd short rest at traffic lights as one-lane only.

The climb was honestly enjoyable though not just for the climbing but taking in the trees and forest. The road twisted and undulated and I was transfixed the whole time.

Descended back out to sea level briefly to a small beautiful cove where I finished second breakfast from Safeway, then climb back in to the redwoods. Slightly easier climb this time around, more mellow gradient, then turn off on to the 'scenic' route, no commercial vehicles allowed. Wow oh wow, what a road. More climbing, steeper now, but not too far as most of it already done. Then just had a 2-3% descent through forest of massive redwoods. Speed never gets too high, but I kept it in check anyway and just cruised down in wonder. What a fantastic road, one of the highlights of the ride so far.

I pull over a few times for different photos etc, before finally popping out over the lagoons of Humboldt park. There was another one-lane road work and the sign worker said he usually gets cyclists to go last, unless he reckons I can beat the cars out the other end. Challenge accepted! He gives me a ten second gap to the first car, and there's two miles of works. The surface wasn't great in a few spots so had to slow down here and there, but still gapped the first car out by 20 seconds. Done!

A little more undulating after the first descent than I really could be bothered with, but I kept the legs turning and finally got to Patrick's Point. I was mapped to go to Big Lagoon but double checking online last night realised it didn't have hiker/biker and didn't want to pull full site prices.

Site and PP is just a big grassy field, actually with some sun for once! Noone else here, so will be just me. Is a bear cache though, firepit and tap. Washrooms round the corner. I dump stuff in the cache then go for a shower. Get quarters from the camp host and only need 2 as shower quite decent. Hottest one yet. Turns out shower is a bit broken though so even after time expires it keeps pumping though at half strength.

Detour out to the actual Patrick's Point for a few photos, then back to camp to set up tent, etc. I forage for left over logs from other fire rings as too cheap to pay $8 for a round of firewood. Find plenty and manage to get something going.

Starts to get dark so get dinner cooked. Mushroom soup, spiced bean rice, and tinned chicken. Get too hot with dinner and soup, end up in shorts and tshirt next to fire.

Decide to try a couple night photos as it's so clear and have the fire going. Come out okay for a quick job so quite pleased. Fire starts to burn out so it's bed time.

Tomorrow, Avenue of the Giants!
