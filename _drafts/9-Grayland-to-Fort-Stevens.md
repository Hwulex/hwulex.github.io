title: 9 Grayland to Fort Stevens
---

My alarm went off at 05:30 as I knew I had a lot of distance to put  in today and I wanted to get an early start, as long as the weather cooperated. I didn't mind starting in some light rain as it was meant to be sunny later. However, that early it was still pouring. The forecast still said easing and clearing by 9am so I went back to sleep. After a few wakes and checks to ongoing rain, I finally got up around 07:30 as if the rain stuck to the forecast I could at least have the bike packed and be myself changed and ready to go when it eased.

I soaked some oats overnight for breakfast which were so good. First time I'd had them since Fort Ebey and I questioned why I didn't do this every day. Probably from being outside I don't want the attractant smelling all night! An apple and a chai tea later, I used my last Washington State Parks token and took a quick hot 3 minute shower to try and loosen my stiff neck before the long day.

It was still raining on the walk back so I sat and read some book for a while. Until apparently 09:10 that is when I next checked the time. Damn! I checked outside, rain had stopped! Nice! But damn, as I hadn't actually packed as I had meant to, just got distracted by the book.

Okay, a fast pack it was, I needed to get going. I had 6-hours of riding to do averaging 20km/h, and with breaks, food, etc, I was budgeting closer to 8. Leaving by 10 meant a 6pm arrival at the next site, a bit later than I'd like, but I'll have to take it..

Quickest pack ever, I was changed and out the door at 09:45!

Cool start, sunshine later.

Beautiful views all day, probably most open and view filled yet.

Over bridge to Astoria.

Half hour detour to Safeway.

Fort Stevens staff nicest ever. Campsite so great.
