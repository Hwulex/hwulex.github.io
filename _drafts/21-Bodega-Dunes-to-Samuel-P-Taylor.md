title: 21 Bodega Dunes to Samuel P Taylor
---


Alarm went off around 7am, but I'd already woken as it was a bright morning. I didn't exactly rush to get packed though as I knew I only had 65km to do today and having a few more people around was prepared for a more social morning.

Oats for breakfast while I packed the sleeping bag and mat, then I sat and read my Kindle for a while. After a chapter I change in to the bike clothes so the packing process can continue. I get most of it packed up at a leisurely pace while chatting to Tim a little about San Fran.

Once all packed, Abbey and Ruth are up having breakfast so go over to chat to them for a while before I finally roll out of camp around 10:30. I punch out to the road quickly to get the gratuitous camp sign image as I didn't get it on arrival last night, but I then double back in to camp to take the cut-through to the bay.

At the bay I don't see any pelicans to start with, then notice two huge birds swooping across the water toward me. I get the camera and snap a few photos as the pelicans fly over and by which was pretty cool.

Back up the little one-way street (that a truck drove the wrong way down, we're not the only ones) and to the market store from the night before to get a breakfast wrap and more Lays peanut butter sandwich biscuits 'cause they're just excellent.

I then roll out of town with first planned stop to be Tomales thanks to Tim's bakery recommendation. It was spot on. There's a little sandwich deli there with a bakery next door so I grab a veggie sandwich and a cookie, then a pesto cheese stick and blueberry scone next door. Yeah yeah, all the food!

Chat outside while I eat half the sandwich with a guy on a nice looking Honda CBR who had ridden out from Marin. Very nice guy, who had visited Vancouver a bunch.

Roll out of Tomales full of stomach and pockets. Down a hill with warning of flooding so guessing near a river and *wham* head wind. Did not see that coming, hadn't felt a breath all day. Fortunately changed heading pretty soon and was bearing south around Tomales Bay which was beautiful.

I assumed it was ocean lagoon and being salt water would be prime oyster farming territory. In fact it reminded me a lot of Knysna in South Africa which is a huge oyster farm. Sure enough further around the bay there was oyster farming and oyster shacks for miles.

After some small rolling but energy sapping hills I came to Port Reyes which was nicer and a little larger than expected. I locked the bike up next to the German couple who were at Bodega the night before and went to get groceries.

Tim had mentioned by this point we're in Marin County where there's money and it will be more expensive and he was sure right. I picked up the same stuff as I've been getting all trip, the difference being two beers but the total was $50. Oof.

Still, I found two pretty good sounding beers for the evening.
- Hangar 24: Orange Wheat
- Peanut Butter Milk Stout

From Port Reyes I continue to Olema where there's another small store and deli with a sign for ice cream, so I stop in for the latter.

From Olema it's a left turn in land and over a decent size hill, then on the downhill roll I see a sign for Cross Marin Trail, which is paved. Turns out that's where I was meant to be going anyway for the GPS and I follow this perfectly flat mostly well paved trail all the way to camp.

$7 for hike and bike this time, but the showers are only 50c for 5 minutes. Sadly the shower is piss weak and not that hot, though it does definitely go for longer than 5 mins. Eventually I get bored and turn it off.

James, whose name I now know, is already in camp. I recognised his tarp from Gualala, and he said he recognised my tent from there too. We exchange stories and chat a little.

Back to camp I chat to the bearded Canuck, whose name I now learn is Gerard.

Some guy in a repurposed military transporter starts playing his bongo drums which I find quite okay. There's someone else though that takes offense and comes to confront the man. There's some pushing, the drum gets snatched, then bongo man pulls out the meanest looking machete I've seen and the two stand off. James and Gerard go to intervene and help keep the peace. These are Americans so I'm staying the hell away before somebody pulls a gun.
