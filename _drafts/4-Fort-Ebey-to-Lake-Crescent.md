title: 4 Fort Ebey to Lake Crescent

Up and packed only a few minutes behind planned, then a little longer for a toilet stop and suddenly I had only 45 mins to ferry departure time. This is the only time on the whole trip I have to work to someone else's schedule and I'd decided on the 08:45 ferry and didn't want to miss it as one of the boats is offline (rudder repair) so crossings are half the usual meaning 1h30m wait to the next one.

Google had told me it's 1h cycling, which usually means around 40 mins, so it was gonna be tight but doable. Rolled out of camp at 08:01, put my head down, skipped the scenic marginally longer route, and just pounded down (well up actually it turns out) the highway.

This wasn't the planned route so couldn't rely on the Wahoo for directions. Stop to check the map, make a right, head down and spin some more. Get to the ferry at 08:36. Sweating a bit, but glad to be there!

Two years ago I had road tripped to Portland and on the return leg  drove back up the coast from Cannon Beach, going right after Astoria to cut up to Port Townsend skipping out Olympia. This is where my ride down this time would differ as from the ferry I made west for Port Angeles.

The ride there was, it turned out, a lot different from what I expected. Apparently there is an Olympic Discovery Trail, akin to the Whistler Valley Trail network which goes a good chunk of the way there. It's built on an old railway bed too so basically flat! 

I didn't know about this trail until I got on to it as I honestly didn't really do much route planning. I have a Wahoo ELEMNT Bolt bike GPS which does turn by turn navigation. It will sync routes planned in Strava. Strava has an excellent route planner which takes in to account its global heatmap and will calculate a route between points you click by using "popularity"




Road closure, divert, Log Cabin Resort booked but free spot

### Roadside Random

Today was definitely going to be the laptop I saw smashed in to four bits.

That got trumped by the concrete manatee holding a mailbox.

The manatee was later equalled by a **dressed** dried earth sculpture of a woman holding an umbrella. Next to her was a giant four-foot high spider made of the same stuff. So weird.
