title: 10 Fort Stevens to Cape Lookout
---


Up at 07:00, but took longer to pack than I wanted so didn't leave until 09:05. Deciding to ride straight south instead of going around the point to see the beaches and sights, I remembered seeing a sports store on the way in. I'd finally had enough of my punctured Thermartest going down and waking up against a cold floor every two hours, then having to blow it up again before I can go back to sleep.

Add to that my trusty 10-year old v1 Jetboil looks like it finally crocked it. I would light it only for it to extinguish five seconds later. Continuously. This made cooking last night and this morning hard, so I was also interested in a backup stove in case that keeps happening.

Sport 5 whatever shop 10 am. Delays ride further. Not very good selection, but get sleep pad and stove. Will ditch stove at least if I find a smaller one.

See Oregon coast cycle route sign swear to the right, dead end to beach. More wasted time.

Cold rain over last big climb, get cold, stop at Montizano for hot drink, bagel and cake.

Cannon beach, Haystack rock, have been before.

Flatter roads. Brighton!

Stop at Tillimack cheesery, starts to pour once inside. Lucky! Hole up a big, call Siobhan, rain stops. Go out, start riding, realise feet getting wet but can't find poop bags, stop at store to get some, starts raining! Missed again!

Rain mostly stops, cross road to camp shop in case better stove. Only worse.

Go through town, find Safeway, get dinner and next day lunch supplies, plus breakfast fruit.

Still in waterproofs, get too hot riding to cape now rain has stopped. Ride last 10km in usual gear, plus foot bags.

Arrive at camp 18:40, about 20 minutes before sundown. Find a camp spot, $6 hike and bike. Get warmer clothes on, grab camera, take few snaps of sun setting. That's it, getting dark. Shower, charge stuff with rangers, only just make it back in time to retrieve.

Speak to Siobhan, charge stuff in toilets as usual.

Cook cream broccoli soup + rice + chicken. Cookie dessert. Jetboil carked, use new stove, burn jetboil pan inside.

Start fire with not many resources.

Write journal, washrooms to switch charging devices. Read a few pages of book, now after midnight so alarm set for 06:30
