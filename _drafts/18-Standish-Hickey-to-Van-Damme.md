title: 18 Standish-Hickey to Van Damme
---


Early rise again this morning as the route profiles say there's lots of climbing ahead and don't want to be straight slogging all day.

Packed up and out of camp at 07:30. I leave the other three finishing packing and getting coffee. I do take the time to make oats before I leave to get some slow burning carbs in me for the hills.

As Rob had described, it's basically straight downhill out of the campsite so I'm glad I had the warmers and jacket on as it was only 7deg. Just before Leggett I turn off west for HW1 and the coast. More downhill coasting before the GPS shows "the hill". I stop on the flat, strip off the jacket, and start spinning.

Now Rob had talked a lot of smack about this hill, not just the length and pitch, but also just going on and twisting never being able to see the top, treelined and boring. I could not have disagreed more. Some of it was true, the twisting, not seeing the top, but it was honestly the best road I have ever ridden on my road bike. Pure joy of a climb from bottom to top. The surface was good, if not great, fresh lines down the center and edge, never in a straight line just constant twisting and 5-7% the whole way up.

Unfortunately, about 50m from the summit, I felt a rhythm in my back wheel which felt a little to consistent and sure enough it was a flat. My first of the trip! Not bad for 1600km in! I rode the flat the short stretch to the top where there was a turnout and flipped the bike. Just a small pinhole in the old tube, some kinda thorn or spike on the road. New tube in, CO2 discharged, and I was ready to roll again. Reflecting on the flat, I was glad it happened just before the top than just after as getting one on the steep fast descent would be way worse. I'd made it to the top in 35m from leaving camp so was pretty happy with that.

It was close to 350m straight up to the top, no real breaks. Not taking anything away, it's a decent climb, but for me it's equivalent to a Hey Bud lap but over a much greater distance, so it felt really good.

There was a smile on my face the whole way up the climb, but I honestly giggled and maybe let out a few whoops on the way down the descent. The same twisty windy great road the whole way down. Tight in places, real tight, 10mph limits, so you couldn't just pin it, but just so enjoyable. The corners were banked ffs!

There were a few false bottoms even with a slight rise on the way down, but by the time I was done for reals, I'd descended over 700m. Wowza.

Some flat spinning and I hit the second part of the climb on my profile, but not before I'd passed the turn off for Usal at which I'd fortunately decided not to camp confirmed by Rob and the others when I mentioned it. Nasty dirt road, a struggle even on a good 4x4, so it would be a terrible hike-a-bike with no potable water at the end.

The second climb was less enjoyable than the first, for a couple reasons. The legs still felt good, I wasn't really fatigued - the summer of punchy mountain bike climbing saw to that - but it was generally less "scenic" as the forest wasn't as nice, it was less twisty and instead had a slightly steeper overall grade 7-9%. It was much smaller than the first so was over the top without too much struggle, and then more fun descending, eventually popping out at the ocean!

The road then just traversed the coast the whole way, undulating but no real climbs so no long descents either. Enough pitch to get to the lower gears, but over pretty quickly.

Stopped in a few spots for photos. It was a little overcast, or just a thick haze, but looked quite moody which befit the rugged rocky outcrops.

Further along the coast and I start to find beaches and definitely more traffic, I'm getting back to civilization.

At Fort Bragg I turn right at the Purple Rose like Rob had described to pick up the old railway line path from MacKerricher State Park, now repurposed as a hike/bike/horse trail. It was a bit beat up in places, but was a real nice way to go instead of on the highway.

At the end of the line, just around the corner I get lunch at One Cafe: shitake mushroom hash with sweet potatoes, peppers, poached egg and sour dough. Honestly it looked a little underwhelming, but it tasted excellent and was all organic sustainable and local. Side of earl grey went down well.

Old lady: "best looking man" sat behind them. 

I roll on and find a Safeway; it's been a few days since I was in one of those! I do technically have dinner supplies for tonight but I wanted to grab something for lunch tomorrow and maybe a few other bits and treats, oh and more breakfast oats! Eating 2-pkts a morning means supplies don't last long.

With the backpack loaded I'm back on the road and heading to Mendocino. The weather has warmed further, the haze mostly burnt off, so I ditch the warmers, the jacket having long since gone.

I cross over some bridges with the most spectacular little cove beaches. Most are too narrow to stop to get a photo, and too busy to try to get one while rolling and maybe cause a wobble. I had to get one of them captured though so I park the bike on the far side of the bridge after Russian Gulch then walk back on the tiny sidewalk for a photo. Fantastic.

I go past the Mendocino Grove campsite I had set as the destination before realising it was $100/night to pitch your own, and continued to Van Damnme on the guys' recommendation. I started to question if I should have just stopped at Russian Gulch after that view, but push on and am rewarded with a twisty short descent to a lovely beach and the state park entrance directly opposite. Okay, good choice.

I'm hit with a $10 hike/bike fee when I'm used to half that, but given I never paid the first two nights in Cali I can't much complain.

First in camp, I pick my spot and erect the tent and shower. Another cyclist, Troy, arrives who is going north to the Lost Coast. I then go to sit in the sun at the beach and dry out the towel.

No signal. Second time all trip, both back to back. 

When I'm back, an older fellow pushing a scooter-ish motorbike on a little trailer pulls in. Apparently given he's pushing it he can classify as a hiker and they let him stay in the cheap site,

A very interesting fellow in tights, skirt, fitted shirt, beret and little glasses. On introduction I also notice a little makeup, turquoise nails, and an assortment of rings, etc.

We chat a little and he explains he can't cycle the coast any more just doesn't have it in the legs now at 71. Crikey, good effort for 71, and looks much younger. He still likes to get out to the old cycle spots though, just now has an engine for help. Fair enough! Also likes to adventure in his home area, born and raised in the bay, and doesn't feel the need to fly off everywhere.

Thai cashew vegetable with rice for dinner is excellent. Will get more of these pouch dinners!

It's now dark as I finish this at 19:30 so will pick a new book as I finished the previous last night and the preview-chapters this afternoon and probably read in my tent before sleep. I've found a few sticks for a fire but not sure if I'm bothered about lighting one.
