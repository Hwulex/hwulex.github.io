title: Gear Check
---

I've been planning this trip since I knew I was taking the summer off this year. In the last couple weeks when I thought about it more seriously I have been adding items to a Google Keep list whenever I think of them so that they don't get forgotten come packing day. This is actually pretty standard practice these days for any impending adventure, and it means that I often find fewer essentials left behind. Not everything on the list makes in to the bag, but I am able to choose rather than remember it later once forgotten.

So, most of what I decided to pack is in this photo, aside from a few others that I will try to include in the list.
