title: 5 Lake Crescent to Kalaloch
---

Honestly today was pretty boring. I had an extra 20-odd km to do thanks to the road closure detour: camp back to the closure was 5km, then around the lake another 17km. Added to the 107km planned from the original campsite and it was going to be a long day. Only around 800m climbing though so some respite there.

Cycling around the lake was beautiful, a real highlight, and reminded me of riding at home in Canada, Fantastic views, though mostly over the shoulder; I stopped a few times for photos.

Eventually campsite and far end, looked nice.,

Uphill road out of lake was scraped back.

Rest of the ride was super boring long straight tree lines roads.

Forks: *The home of Twilight*.
What a claim, but man do they milk it. There's a banner hoisted above the highway as you enter town. There's signs next to the highway welcoming Twilight fans. Even the sandwiches in the grocery store deli were Twilight themed. In name only so far as I could see, as one was just a turkey wrap, and at that point I stopped paying attention.

27 deg C eating lunch in Forks. Remained around 24 in sun, 20 in shade, all the way until about 15km from the coast when temp suddenly dropped when I started to descent. A degree per km until the coast it was 10deg.

Nice views, would be spectacular on a clear day but already foggy and cloudy. From one viewpoint I stopped at, seemingly in the middle of nowhere, I thought I saw a dog. Definitely a dog. Wait, is that a *seagull*. Holy toledo! Now either I'm much closer to that beach than the foggy air would let me believe, or that thing is a monster. I got closer the edge and sure was a couple hundred feet up on a cliff so that was one honkin' great bird.

Found campsite, one spot left. Tried at lodge, nothing. Went back took single remaining car-camp spot she'd let me have as hike-bike site had someone else in it, but charged me the full whack $22 anyway. Cheers. At least last night was free so split it to $11/night ain't too bad.

Back to lodge to abuse charging station.
