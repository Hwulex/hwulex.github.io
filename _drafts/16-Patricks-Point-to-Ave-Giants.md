title: 16 Patricks Point to Ave Giants
---

Phone had died last night but got some juice in it from battery backup. Left it turned off to save power expecting alarm to still work but it didn't. Awake with sun at 07:15 then instead of 06:30. Still managed to be packed up and ready to go by 08:30, even with oats for brek. Maybe I am getting better at this?

Packing was a bit tricky too as everything was *soaked* in dew. That's the wettest everything has been, even more than the morning it showered at Beverly. Used the chamois sponge as best I could then just had to roll the tent.

Road for the first section was pretty terrible. Lots of cracks and holes, then at one point was just straight gravel. GPS was pushing me on to another section but I ducked out on to the highway as views were obstructed anyway and would rather make progress.

Turned off the highway after Trinidad on to section of the Hammond Trail which, like the Olympic Discovery Trail, is old railway line repurposed for horse, hike and bike. Very pleasant to be on (mostly) good surface away from traffic and logging trucks.

Across the river, the trail spits you on to quiet roads but they are real old between the farms and are real chewed up. Couldn't take your eyes off it for more than a couple seconds or you'd probably buckle a wheel.

Eventually cross the bridge in to Eureka. Cedric had warned me about the place, and when I pulled in I was tempted by an Egg McMuffin but the clientele standing outside promptly changed my mind. Maybe he had a point...

I rolled on further and found signs for "Old Town Eureka" with coffee shops, and other hipster shops. Sure enough it was actually really nice and I found a great little coffee shop to get an iced chai and a parfait, and steel some power as the campsite had no sockets last night and everything was running low.

Just round the corner I stopped at Co-op which I now know is basically wholefoods. Fortunately some good deals so I grabbed some pre-made curry sachets and pre-cooked rice, along with some delicious looking energy bars.

Keep rolling on, Highway 101 feels more like a freeway leaving Eureka. Eventually I get GPS prompted to turn off and I hit a nice quiet road with some resurfaced stretches so it's going pretty good, though I wonder if they actually steam roller the new stuff as it's not very level. I then hit the workers actually resurfacing  and no they don't roller it. In fact I ride on to a brand new section and my tyres are making a groove! Not only that but the tar is sticking to them so I start to worry they won't survive!

I get to a literally just-laid patch they're raking out and decide to walk in the verge to avoid the wheels going over it. Back on the bike after I pick up a lot of loose stones, dust, and other debris on the tyres. I hope friction clears them off soon.

I then get to the kicker of a hill I've seen on my GPS profile. 2km straight up, minimum grade 10%, up to 15%. It was also 30deg in the open sun, so that was a real grunt to the top. When I got there, bumped in to a couple other tourers: 2 girls that had also ridden (and were) from Vancouver, one of which had broken a spoke but they seemed to be doing okay and knew of a bike shop the next town down only 3 miles away.

I left them and rolled on. More hw101 until I turned off in to Rio Dell. Never know what to expect with just names on the map, but came across a great little coffee shop called Shotz and this time got a chai milkshake and a burrito. Good lunch! Fuelled up, I pressed on through Scotia before rejoing hw101 until the signs for Ave of Giants appeared.

Beautiful ride through the redwoods, though I have to admit a little underwhelming given that I'd seen so much impressive forest the day before after Crescent City on the detour road that I wasn't quite as struck this time around. Lots of huge trees, but I honestly expected another level.

Got to Hidden Springs camp and pretty deserted. No attendant. No hiker/biker on the map either which I swear I'd confirmed online. I loop around and eventually see a small handwritten not on one of the posts for hiker/biker but it's not great. I think about heading 10km back to Burlington as that looked like such a good site. Reading online Hidden Springs sounded great, plus the two Vancouver girls were meant to be heading here so thought I'd at least have them for company.

I have a look on the other side and find three touring guys that have just taken a regular site over as they couldn't find the proper place. I was happy to just join their party and the four of us just stay on the site together. No sign of the Vancouver girls. If they had delays at the bike shop, I wonder if they got to Burlington and just pulled in there as it was closer. Probably best anyway as this camp not the greatest. Though it does have showers, and a plug socket inside, so got what I need.

I chat to Rob, one of the three, about ongoing plans and need a new spot aside from Usal as that's offroad access and I don't want to go there now. He suggests another spot that will still put me in Mendocino the next day so on schedule.

That sorted and with pea and paneer curry in me, it's bed time.
