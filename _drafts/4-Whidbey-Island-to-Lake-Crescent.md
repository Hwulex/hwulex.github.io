title: 4 Whidbey Island to Lake Crescent
---

Previous road trip went from Astoria inside route to Port Townsend, therefore this was all new terrain for me. What a delight the Olympic Discovery Trail is! A connecting trail extending from Port Townsend to the West Coast, with the majority of it being exclusive access trail, it's mostly paved and largely keeps you off major roads.

Kick out from Port Angeles to Lake Crescent was kinda dull, but climbing much easier than anticipated. Road closed at MP232, which was closer than my Internet research had suggested.
