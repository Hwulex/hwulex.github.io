title: 20 Gualala to Bodega Dunes

Alarm at 06:45. Decided a little later as there's not much point waking up earlier as it's still dark. The 20 mins or so before daylight though allows me to do tent-bound stuff like let down and roll my mat and stuff my sleeping.

Oats for brek, though only one pack as I also have last night's yoghurt I didn't eat due to the smores, as well as an apple.

On the road at 08:30 and I'm keen to put in to action the camp host's plan for me from the day before.

- Mile 48: 2 Fish bakery
- Mile 31: Dangerous shoulder-less road, watch for RVs
- Mile 21: Cafe Aquatica, Jenner

Route profile doesn't show any real big hills, just mostly undulating terrain. I have the iPod Shuffle going to entertain me as quite a bit of the riding is a little inland from the coast so a little mundane at times. Where we do pop back to the ocean however it is stunning as always, especially the inlets the road goes around.

I actually miss 2 Fish bakery as it's in a building marked Stewart's Point Store and it was only a 2 Fish van in the parking lot as I rode past, down a hill, that it caught my attention. I doubled back and glad I did for an excellent second breakfast. First place I've seen London Fog on the menu so that it was, alongside a lemon poppyseed scone. I also got the veggie sarnie to go to munch on later. I already knew I'd also stop at Jenner, but camp-food is always on the mind too.,

There are roadworks right around the 31 mile mark which works in my favor as it's down to one lane. I get through the lights and then have clear road behind me for ten minutes. The winding goes on a ways so when the next wave of traffic comes I pull in to let it pass, then pull back in after the last car. Works out great!

There are a couple of larger hills around the middle of the ride, but again there are traffic lights near the start so apply the same strategy. I get to ride up moderate hills without any traffic worry. Over the top of the last one, I was treated to a great view down the other side of a wonderful switchback hairpin filled road. Proved difficult to photograph but had fun going down.

Arrive at Jenner and I find the Cafe Aquatica. Get inside the door to join a queue of 5 people but doesn't take long to get served. Great sandwich choice, chowder, and lots of baked goods. I get the Portabella Pirate, savory (carrot and broccoli) scone, ginger and coconut scone, and a thai iced tea. I've really gotta find out what that iced tea was because it was just fantastic!

I tried a little of the savory but was to be saved for later. The ginger coconut was eaten after the excellent portabello, which was served with other veggies in a pesto foccacia, with some salad.

There's a bossa nova band playing in the garden the whole time and I sat in a seat at the front of the deck but looking back taking in the people, the ocean, the band, and the cafe. Fantastic. I sat for over an hour just soaking it all in.

I drag myself up from a very comfortable place and get back on the road, but only about 17km to go.

Find campground easy enough and setup on some flat sand. Three people here already, and Vancouver Beard gets in shortly after me. Eventually there are 6 tents tonight.

Shower is best on the trip yet. $1 for 2 tokens, 2 mins each. Very strong pressure, and very hot. Didn't even have it on full heat. Using my usual "find the source" logic, the token dispenser for the shower has a small trapdoor beneath it where it is plugged in. I open to find a spare socket. BINGO! That's my hidey charge spot for the day and night. Left my phone in while showering, then GPS in all afternoon.

Head to the grocery via a cut through to the road next to the bay. Taking some photos of pelicans and sea otters when the tall girl I'd seen at the Jenner cafe came out the same way. She is Abbey, from (south of) Perth, Aus. We get to chatting and head toward groceries together. On the way we find a wine tasting place which seems like a good diversion.
 
Wine flight $15 for three: Sav Blanc, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel. Good chat about how first trip for both of us. Her first time in Canada. Spent two weeks in Van, bought a bike, cycles the coast! Week in Seattle, week in Portland. Few days in SF then Central America for a month, come back to finish San Diego leg, then Mexico for 6 months. Sounds alright!

Grocery store up this shitty one way lane, but stock is decent. Back down the one-way street the wrong way and back to camp to cook. Cream of Mushroom Campbell's, two ramen noodle, tin tuna. Carrot cake and coconut macaroon after. Oh and a snickers. Double.


### Roadside Randoms

Honestly, either people chuck less stuff out their windows here, the adopt-a-highway program litter control is much better, but the verge was completely void of interesting items today, and baron of litter. Roadkill was pretty much all I saw: three skunks and a deer.


### RV Name

- Vibe Extreme XL
- Puma (did I already use that one? I had seen one before)


### Notable Wildlife
