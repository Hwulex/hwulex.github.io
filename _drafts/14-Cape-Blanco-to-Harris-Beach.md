title: 14 Cape Blanco to Harris Beach
---


Out of camp 08:45, can't bomb the hill out due to gravel, Riding up hill feels really warm, already 13 deg, Get to highway ditch jacket and leg warmers. Arm warmers don't last much longer, Soon 19deg.

Proper coastal ride, not much inland riding, beautiful all the way. Two big hills. Cape Sebastian? Loooong drag, 5-7% the whole way for several km, 78kim/.h down the other side,

Scenic corridor, stopped at Windy Point / Arch Rock for lunch.

Harris Beach by 14:30, but Fred Meyer for groceries. Skip ocean swim in favor of shower and dry towel after.

Walk down to Harris Beach. Fine. Climkb Harris Butte. Fine.

Windy AF. First time used more than 2 stakes for the tent. Seems to hold okay. Ted asked at Beverly Beach how it went in the wind, I guess now I find out. 

Cupasoup then ginger chicken and rice from Fred's. Yogurt, Chocolate milk. Bed.

Wind died completely. Strange for night time I thought. Not sorry mind. 

Seemed to pitch up next to a snorer. Even with wind gone, might still need those ear plugs. 

California tomorrow!
