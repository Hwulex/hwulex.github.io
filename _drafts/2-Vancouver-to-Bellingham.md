title: 2 Vancouver to Bellingham
---

Leg 2, but technically day 3 as I needed an extra day in the city to organise some extra bits and properly pack the bike.

Unfortunately, whilst making a dash to MEC for some last minute pieces, my old road bike, on which I did the aforementioned Coast500 tour, was stolen from outside the store. Ironically I was deciding on a padlock to take with me when it happened. Not the one that was on that bike, clearly! Sucky to start with, but I was now stranded at MEC. Siobhan to the rescue! Also Indian takeout.

So Wednesday, set off



### Roadside Random

 - Dungeness crab shell. I was halfway between Birch Bay and Bellingham but far enough from the ocean it certainly didn't walk there and die of natural causes. I like to imagine someone snacking on it in a truck and just tossing the finished shell out the window.
