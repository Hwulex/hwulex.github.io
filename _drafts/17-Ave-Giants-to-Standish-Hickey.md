title: 17 Ave Giants to Standish-Hickey
---


Alarm at 05:45, up and pack up quick. Don't really need to get away early today as have a short day ahead, but there was no price for bikers at camp and figure we'll get out before the ranger gets around.

Roll out of camp 07:40 and quite the opposite of last night when it was still around 20 going to bed, it was 6 deg! Real cold morning, and very different to the last few mornings rolling out at 13 deg.

Having the shorter today and all heading to the same next spot, I decided to roll with Rob, Tony and Mitch for the day. We all left kinda separately but regrouped in Miranda for coffee (hot choc in my case) and breakfast burrito.

Roll out of there and we had a casual pace going, much more relaxed than when riding solo, but we only have 65km to get to camp and tomorrow is going to be a big climbing day so I'm happy to take some rest.

Our first destination is Garberville as Mitch has broken his second spoke this morning and there's allegedly a bike shop there that we can visit and cross fingers for supplies. The ride there is pretty chill, we take an off-101 detour through Redway then climb in to Garberville. Rob takes us to the "bike shop" which looks more like a SportStop, but the lady inside leads us out the bike to where "the previous owner was a bike mechanic and we've left it all back there". We go through the back door to find a full work shop, stocked with spares. We fossick around and find some 290mm spokes which are bang on for Mitch, and nipples to go with them.

It takes a while to get it going, but the wheel is fixed. Meanwhile I go to the cafe opposite and have a chai milkshake and a tomato pepper scone. Once the wheel is done and I've helped Mitch as I can and we set off again, I decide to go alone at my own pace, while still staying pretty chilled.

There's not too many kms to camp, and only three climbs, none of which are too long or steep. The worst thing is the heat, it's mid thirties in the blazing sun by now. I stop at a river view point, lean my bike on a telegraph pole and a gecko pops out! A stark reminder of the terrain and warmer climes in which I now find myself.

Along the ride we do still go in and out of groves of redwoods, but overall there is a lot of hw101 and it is open and baron.

I get to Standish-Hickey camp at 13:45, earliest arrival yet after 3h30m riding, 6h10m actual time. There's a store opposite the entrance so I jump in sand find a rice-stuffed grape leaf hummus wrap. What a find out in the middle of nowhere. I get some lime jalapeno chips, coconut water, and a Haagen Daaz caramel ice cream.

I get to camp expecting a bit more going on, but apart from four tents huddled together it is deserted. This is the last camp at which you kinda have to stay before you attack the next stretch which is almost 2000m of climbing and 100km to Fort Bragg or Mendocino.

I have the luxury of picking my tent spot and I find a good one isolated so I won't get neighbours after sleeping in the eye of the storm like last night.

No cell service. 

I get in to my spare shorts and singlet and first order is laundry. It's still mid-20 deg even in the trees so should dry out well.

Rob arrives first of the crew seeming pretty chill. We set up our spots, get showered changed etc, then bets on when the others will arrive. We both agree around 16:30, but they beat our estimate by 15 minutes.

When they're showered and feeling human we head across the street to The Peg House and they have a tempeh burger which I have with a potato salad side. Protein shake and chocolate brownie after.

Mitch has lemon pepper smoked salmon which is delicious.
