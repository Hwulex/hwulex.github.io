title: 8 Aberdeen to Grayland
---


An excellent night's rest in a luxuriously comfortable bed in my AirBnb. I woke to the ground outside the window soaking wet. I had heard it once in the night when I woke up, and Sara, the host, said she'd heard sleet or hail at one point in the night on her tin roof. Seems like I made the right call in not camping!

Breakfast was served at 07:30. A wonderful spread of melon starter followed by scrambled fresh eggs from the yard, English muffin, and a homemade peach butter that was just fantastic. IF anybody is passing through Aberdeen, you have to stay with Sara, she is just the best host. She even had coffee poured for Ashlee (the guest in her other room) and a pot of tea for me. I don't even remember stating that, but she got it right.

I sat with my second mug of tea and chatted with Sara about her career as a nurse and some of the places she has lived and worked across the USA, and also about her beloved Yorkie dogs, one of which very sadly had to be put down just the day before, not long after I had arrived. Sara was obviously deeply saddened, as was the remaining Yorkie, the resting dog's daughter.

After some time chatting and realising we had a break in the weather, as it had rained on and off through breakfast, I packed my gear on to the bike and was ready to go. IT was pretty fresh outside, so limb warmers and jacket on.

I wasn't having to travel far today, only 45km or so to get to Grayland and I'd found a couple interesting bits around Aberdeen to see before I left, so it was nice to mosey at a relaxed pace.

First stop was the Historical Seaport, home to the tall ships Lady Washington and Hawaiian Chieftain. At first I didn't think they were docked as I couldn't see them , neither as I crossed the road drawbridge over the river, nor when I reached the entrance. After speaking with the girl working out front, she informed me tours were in the evening and sailing was Thursday but I was welcome to see them and photo from the water's edge. She explained you can't see all their glory as it's low tide so they're largely obstructed. I guess that's why I didn't see them, I was looking for something taller.

The ships were beautiful and I wish I could still be around to sail on one, but alas that will have to wait for another time. They spend their winters in Cali so perhaps there some time. It's an 8-week transfer for them, though they can't both go to the same port as Lady is too deep. Aberdeen is the only <<inseret fact here about deep water port>>

After the ships, I crossed back over the bridge now it was 11am to go to the Star Wars shop! Thanks to my friend Lacy for notifying me about this. I got there to be met by a "summer hours 11:30 to 17:30" sign which was disappointing. Still, I took some photos of the outside and the mural, and had a nosey through the windows. It was stacked floor to ceiling. A sign claimed 100,000 products and I could believe it. The even had a 5ft diameter Millennium Falcon hanging from the ceiling.

With that stop (sorta) ticked, I set off for reals towards Grayland. The ride over was a very enjoyable one. VIews of the ocean for large stretches, few bridges to cross, and a huge smooth shoulder to ride in the whole way.

En route I passed a winery. Well, it'd be rude not to at least have a look. I parked and locked the bike then had a little wander around the grounds to find far stretching elaborate gardens. The whole space was broken down in to several small gardens of varying themes. From a wedding area, to blown glass, to beach combing claims, to a 9-hole pitch n putt golf course!

After a wander round, I went inside as the lure of bakery was strong. After looking at their restaurant menu I decided to grab lunch of a vegan burger with side of soup, and a tasting flight of wine. Now *this* is cycle touring!

The burger was fantastic, the patty one of the best I've had. A house made quinoa and vegetable mix, with balsamic glazed salad and Sriracha aeoli. The soup was an excellent tomato basil, with shaved parmesan. The five wines I picked were all excellent I have to say. One white, three reds, and a dessert wine, but not like what you may expect. This was a syrah blend with *chocolate*! Man, if I couldn't swallowed the thought of carrying a bottle for the next thousand miles, I really wanted to walk out with one! Paired with this fantastic new enlightened wine experience I had a four-layer trail-mix carrot cake with Amaretto cream cheese frosting, the second half of which I've just finished for dinner dessert!

So after that excellent refuel stop, I pushed on toward Grayland, but first I was making a detour up the peninsula to Westport where there was a lighthouse and more ocean views. Unfortunately the lighthouse was closed, but there was a paved path through the dunes which was a pleasure to ride. At the end of which was a lookout tower were I watched the crashing surf come in., At least 8 foot swells out there. I saw one guy come in with his surf board earlier on. Looks like it's be fun out there!

Double back the way I came up then a few km more and I arrived at Grayland State Park. I was 20 mins late for the office which apparently closed at 16:00, which was an hour earlier than the last one I had to checkin at. Having booked a yurt for the night I was a little worried how I would get in. Moreover, my phone had died taking pictures in Westport so I didn't even know which yurt I was in!

A quick stop in the washrooms to plug in and I found my site number, pulled up and the door was locked. Shit. Hang on, a small post box..... aha! The key! I had only been in about 20 minutes and still organising when I actually had a call from the ranger to ask if I was checking in this evening which was unexpected but much appreciated. I explained I was in and had found the key and when IU looked out the door he was parked just right outside. Great service for a state park campsite.

The rest of the evening was pretty standard. Walk to the beach, take some photos, shower, wash out bike clothes at same time, start drying process under hand dryers in wash room, finish in front of the yurt heater.

Dinner was boxed squash soup with a full two serve packet of rice in it. So much food. Oh and that second half of carrot cake. Yum.

### Roadside Randoms
 - Velvet black high-heeled shoe
 - A couch at a bus stop
 - A snaaaaaake!

Apparently possums are a thing here I've learned so it was one I saw the other day. I saw several more dead ones today. They've overtaken squirrels I think as highest roadkill numbers.

### Notable wildlife
 - Pelicans (or some kinda similar looking bird) at Westport
