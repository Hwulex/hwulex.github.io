title: 6 Kalaloch to Ocean City
---


The rain was due to start at 8am, albeit lightly, and then pour at 11am. My plan then was to kick out as much of the distance as I could before that 11am mark. 05:00 I was up and packing but turns out it's a bit slow in the dark and cold but at 06:45 I was rolling and that's not much longer than the usual 1h30m it has been taking me most days.

It was cold to start with, around 5deg, so the arm and leg warmers were on, along with the gloves and rain jacket to start with. Jacket was ditched after the first hill, but the rest stayed on.

I made pretty good progress and aside from the usual neck and bum soreness was feeling okay. Hang on, ahead of me, is that.... a cyclist! I caught up to a woman who appeared to be solo touring, before I learnt she was in a group of 14 making their way to San Diego! She, like the only other tourer I had passed several days earlier, assumed at first glance I was just out for a day ride. Seems my ultralight bike packing setup all black on a black bike is sleek enough not to be obvious.

I was looking forward to catching more of the group and chatting with some other cycle tourists when, just as I caught up to the next in their pack a few km down the road, I had a right turn to make. I stopped at the intersection as there was a small gas station grocery store, and they had hot chocolate! Also a banana and some cashews went down great. I was 80km in and only about 36km to go and aside from a couple of feeble showings, barely a spot of rain had fallen. Yes!

Then, at 10:59, as I got off the phone with Siobhan and trashed my hot chocolate cup, the heavens opened. Didn't seem too ba...... no wait it's pouring. Out came the waterproofs. I lasted probably a good 40 mins before my feet were completely sodden. I've ridden in a lot of heavy rain riding and commuting through English winters but this was something else. It wasn't just heavy, it was lashing wind as well. With the bags on the bike you're a much bigger target and I was getting swung around. Fortunately I'd turned on to the smaller road so wasn't as much traffic around.

I made another quick grocery store stop 10km from destination as I have to take the opportunity when it's there as I don't always know or haven't always determined where the nearest/last one is I'll pass (turned out there's one opposite the campsite). I stocked on a few bits then continued on.

My trusty GPS leading me right to... the wrong campground. Shit. I'd forgotten to update it when I switched from the State campground to the private one. Okay, nevermind, just a 10km detour in the worst weather ever.

When I eventually got to camp, I was pretty sodden. At least my hands and feet were. Under my waterproofs I was surprisingly dry; just wet on my chest from where it runs inside my jacket off my face. Rest of my body, arms, legs, were all dry. Good quality waterproofs are worth it!

Checking over a few things with the site owner: cabin, check; heater; check; power point, check; dryer, nope. Uh oh. Seeing the state I was in and knowing I needed to ride the next day, he very graciously allowed me access to his personal laundry hut so I could wash and dry my clothes. Thank you mr Screaming Eagle campsite man!

So to my cute little cabin I'd booked for the night. Knowing the rain wasn't meant to ease up for 24 hours, I didn't want to arrive wet and then try to stay warm in a tent being lashed with wind and rain. It's about 7ft by 10ft inside. Lower portion just over 6ft high as I could just stand, then a small ladder to a loft with a double mattress. Bookcase in one corner, small double shelf in the other with the lamp and heater... and that's it. Great, lots of space to bring the bike inside. Not so great there was nothing to sit on. I brought in one of the turned over wooden benches from outside and with the heater cranked it soon dried out.

The little cabin was actually quite wonderful and I wish there were many more like it along the way. I don't need a large fancy expensive yurt, but sometimes a tent isn't very practical. This little space for $35 was spot on. Best thing was the showers here were free, no stupid tokens or quarters for 3 minutes!

So later in to the evening I spent researching where to go the next day. The schedule is 75km to Greyland but it's meant to start raining again around 7pm and lash on for a solid 36 hours so I didn't really fancy that. I booked an AirBnb in Aberdeen, just 35km up the road where I could get some supplies and another dry night before deciding from there.

By the time I went to sleep at 10:30, it still wasn't raining but I was told by others at the site it was coming, and coming strong.

- Seagull*
- Full height box trailer, just left in the roadside ditch

### Notable Wildlife

- Aside from the dead seagull, I saw my first bald eagle, flying away from me over the Queets river.
