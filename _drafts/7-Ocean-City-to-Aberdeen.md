title: 7 Ocean City to Aberdeen
---


It was nice to sleep on a mattress again after the last three nights on my slowly deflating Thermarest so I slept like a baby. However, when I awoke around 8am, sunshine! Hang on?! I looked at the forecast again and it had completely changed. It hadn't even rained a drop over night. The cheek! After the accuracy of the 11am downpour the previous day I was kinda disappointed. Rain now wasn't due until midday so if I left soon I could even beat it to Aberdeen!

Checkin at <<<the AirBnb>>> wasn't until 12:30 but I figured I could find somewhere to hang out until that time so after another hot shower I packed the bags and bike and got rolling around 09:30.

Duffy's breakfast

Safeway: bagels

AirBnb: hot tub, soup!

### Notable wildlife

A flock of 5 raptors (no, the bird kind) all flying together as a group alongside me for a few seconds while I climbed a steep hill before peeling away and then separating to hunt over a large area. Weird, but super cool.
