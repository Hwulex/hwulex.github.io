title: 1 Whistler to Vancouver
---


This tour was originally going to begin on September 1, when Siobhan and I moved out of our beautiful suite in Whistler and officially became Vancouver residents. This was to be my ceremonial and symbolic leaving town. However, that changed once we got the date of Shate's wedding, for which I would be sticking around.

So September 11 and it's leg 1, Whistler to Vancouver. I've ridden most of this stretch before 2 years ago when some friends and I did our 3-day #Coast500 tour (Whistler > Vancouver Island > Powell River > Sunshine Coast > Whistler) so I knew most of it. Despite heading south from mountain town to coastal city, there's still plenty of hill along the way.

### Roadside Random

This will become a daily thing: weirdest or most interesting thing I see at the roadside.

Today was a car battery. Either that or the completely burnt out shell of a car in the shoulder that three firetrucks screamed past me to tend. Bummer. That's two burning cars [LINK] I've seen on this highway in a week.
